# Snake Game

This is the Capstone project in the [Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213). The code for this repo was inspired by [this](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/212296/snake-game-in-c-with-sdl) excellent StackOverflow post and set of responses.

In this project, we extended this Snake game - allowing players to enter their name and save their high scores to a text file
  >Upon launch, the player is presented with an option to select or enter a name.
  >Accepted characters are `a - z`
  >Users may hit the `esc` key whiles entering their name to visit the main menu again.
